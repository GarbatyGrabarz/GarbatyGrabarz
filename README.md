# 👋 Who am I?
Hi, I’m @GarbatyGrabarz, but humans call me Tomasz

# ❤️ Interests

I’m currently learning how to become a programmer / software developer / code wizard... or whatever else kids call it these days. My weapon of choice is Python.

I never had much of formal training, so I try my best reading things online and doing as many projects as I can. The key is to start them before your mind takes over and yells: "But you don't know how!"

I’m looking for some form of mentoring. I've been coding in Python for over 2 years, but I honestly have no idea what skill level I'm at and what basic things I've missed to learn.
