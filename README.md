# 👋 Who am I?
Hi, I’m @GarbatyGrabarz, but humans call me Tomasz

# ❤️ Interests

My weapon of choice is Python. I have been programming in MATLAB for about six years, after which I have switched to the beloved snake. It's been 3 years and counting!

I never had much of formal training (few courses here and there), so I try my best reading things online and doing as many projects as I can.

I’m looking for some form of mentoring. I've been coding in Python for a while, but I honestly have no idea what skill level I'm at. Is it even measurable? Does it matter? You tell me! :D
